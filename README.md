rawBlog is an opensource Django blogger engine made to suit multiple tastes for various different users.

It's under development to offer a backbone with essentials to anyone willing to make a cool blog, making it possible to create numerous designs and ideas under the same engine, a raw approach to the features that every blog needs, avoiding the unecessary load of information that average bloggers force down your throat, yet being powerful enough to handle anything you'd like to have on your own blog.
